// C++ OOPs
// It is a approach or a programming pattern where the programs are strucutred around object rather than function and logic.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string name;
    int age, roll_number;
    string grade;

//Now if we want to store the value of another person then we need to again declare  other name and age and rollnumber

   cin>>name>>age>>roll_number>>grade;

    string name1;
    int age1, roll_number1;
    string grade1;

// Now if we take cin value of every data type it can be done and we can  print the above as per our requirement 

//but what if we have we want to store 100 student or 1000 or others then what we shoudl we do we can create class
